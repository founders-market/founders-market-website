				<h2>Philip Mngadi</h2>
				<h4>Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer</h4>

				<p>Philip is the Chief Executive Officer of Founders Market, where he is responsible for the growth and management, business operations and strategy, product design and development, legal, public policy, and human resources. He is also the guy behind our social profiles (Twitter, Facebook etc).</p>

				<p>Philip had the idea for Founders Market when he was sitting in a room full of student entrepreneurs, who were going on about how hard it was to find a co-founder as a student. Philip spoke to Evan Smith about this idea; it turns out that Evan was also already working on a skills directory for student entrepreneurs. The two co-founders merged ideas, and Founders Market was born.</p>

				<p>Apart from that, there is nothing much to say about this guy. If you have an enquiry that you can’t ask Evan, Piyush or Izaac; then be sure to pass it on to Philip (<a href="mailto:philip@foundersmarketapp.com">philip@foundersmarketapp.com</a>) – it would be nice to see him do something either than read Malcolm Gladwell books all day.</p>
				
				<p>Philip is currently doing his Undergraduate Law degree at the University College Cork in Ireland. Slated to finish in 2017.</p>
